# Predicting wins in League of Legends

From a qualitative point of view, it seems that the champion pick/ban phase in professional League of Legends matches are extremely important for the outcome of a game. Here we investigate how well the outcome of a professional League of Legends match can be predicted using only information that is available immediately at the end of the pick/ban phase (i.e. the teams, the patch, the league, and of course the champion picks and bans).

Although this project is still a work in progress, we find that the outcomes can be reasonably well predicted using these features alone (cross-validated AUC = 0.80Â±0.01).
